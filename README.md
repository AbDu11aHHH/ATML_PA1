# EE5102/CS6302 - Advanced Topics in Machine Learning Programming Assignment 1

Of the major machine learning paradigms, Generative, Discriminative, and Contrastive models in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and CLIP were evaluated in terms of the inductive biases present in their performance.
